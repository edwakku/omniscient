# This project is abandoned, the app can still be downloaded from here but I wont guarantee it will work.
Anyone is free to fork it, if there is any reason to do so.

# Omniscient
A simple program for Windows that shows your currently active window as a rich presence status on Discord.

## A fair warning
The code is very bad, this was my 1st proper C# and WPF project.

## What you need to build
  - Visual Studio 2019 with WPF
  - Advanced Installer Extension (Not necessary, its just for the installer)
